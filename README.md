# PasswordBank-GUI Programming Term Project
 
 
 # Description
 A WPF project that creates a database full of your usernames and passowrds to store and keep safe.
 This was made prior to my actual database knowledge, so the project incorporates C# Security library
 to create a encrypted data file that the passwords and usernames were stored in. When the app was
 reloaded, the file was decrypted for the user to see their passwords. Additionally, multiple accounts
 could be created, so a multitude of users can also this application to store their passwords.
